# Linguistics server

## Has a transliterator for multiple Indian scripts
## Unique computer-friendly and grammar-friendly orthography
## Work in Progress... Started in 2008 at Univ. of Pune 
## Rewriting,
 The main portion is embedded within MoinMoin 1.9.8. Most of the code is therefore MoinMoin and not mine. The main stuff is in MoinMoin/web/static/HtDocs/
in the directories Transliterator/ and Transliterator_old/ 
There will be a server-side component - implemented through MoinMoin Action scripts (and a Php equivalent), but for now it is static and standalone. 

To Run - download and run the Wikiserver.py script with python. Then point your browser to localhost:8080/
